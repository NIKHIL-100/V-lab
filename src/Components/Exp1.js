    title=" Experiment No. 1 Title: Study of TTL gates"

    theory=" Theory: The TTL Gates are nothing but Transistor-Transistor Logic,
    which is introduced by the Texas instruments in 1964. It is widely
    used family of digital devices. It is a fast, inexpensive & easy to
    use, TIL uses active low as well as active high signals, -ve logic
    may be used as well as +ve logic. In turn this leads to assertion
    level logic, a way of drawing gates & labeling signals that enhances
    circuit analysis. TTL is saturated logic. It has become the most
    popular bipolar type of IC. The 7400 Series, a line of the TTL
    circuit has becomes the most widely used group of bipolar ICs.
    Specifications: 1) Supply Voltage (Vcc): 4.75 to 5.25V. 2)
    High-level I/P. Voltage (Vim): 2V. 3) Low level I/P Voltage (Vi.):
    O.8V. 4) High level O/P Current (lon): O.4mA. 5) Low level O/P
    Current (Io): 8mA. 6) Free Air Operating Temperature: 70°C 1)
    1€7408:- — : It is quad two I/P AND gate. It has DIP packaging. Two
    on each line, like That there are, 4 AND gates. This is also 14pins.
    The 14 pin is supplied with Vec while the 7 pin is at ground.
