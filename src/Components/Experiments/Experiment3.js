          Theory: 
          1. First Theorem:

          It says that NOR gate is equivalent to bubbled AND gate. It states that
          complement of sum of two inputs is equal to, product of complement of individual
          inputs.

          2. Second THeorem:

          It says that NAND gate is equivalent to bubbled OR gate. It states that
          complement of product of two inputs is equal to sum of complement of individual input.
          
          3. Duality theorem:
          It says that starting with any Boolean equation you can derive other Boolean
          equation by
          1. changing each OR sign by AND.
          2. changing each AND sign by OR.
          3. complementing any zero by 1 appearing in the given expression.

          Procedure :
          1. Connect circuit as shown in circuit diagram.

          2. Apply the supply to circuit as pin 14 to +VCC & pin 7 to ground.
          3. Note down the o/p voltage by multimeter.

          4. Verify the equations by observed readings.
